# DefectCycles-StreetManager
Spreadsheet to determine defect cycle stage from DfT Street Manager Inspections export data.

This spreashseet is a simple way to determine defect cycle stage from Street Manager Inspections exprt data.  To setup the spreadsheet you will need to complete some simple copy and paste processes:

In DfT Street Manager, navigate to the Inspections tile and set the search range to a minimum of the last year ("More Filter Options" > "Inspection Date", whilst a shorter period is possible this could miss inspections performed on each works, so a year as minimum is recommended, you can do longer than a year, but there will be more works to view).

Export the Inspeciton ssearch results by going to the bottom of the page on Street Manager and clicking "Export".

Open the Defect Cycle SPreadsheet and the export file. Select all the data (Ctrl + A) in the export file, then copy all the data (Ctrl + C).  Navigate to the Defect Cycle sheet and the "Inspections_export" tab.  Click on Cell A1 and paste the data (Ctrl + V).

You can then view the "Inspection Cycles" tab which will be automatically populated with the Works reference from your data.  Filters have been added to each column, so you can filter by works in the "Escalation/Improvement Plan Needed" column (Column J) that require a plan by ticking the appropriate fields.

The sheet is setup to determine works prior to the new legislation also, should you have pasted a longer duration of inspections into the sheet.

NOTE: You will need to delete the export data and recreate and redownload new data each time, to ensure any changes in inspections are shown.
